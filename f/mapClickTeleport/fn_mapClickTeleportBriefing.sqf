<br/><br/>
A HALO jump consists of three stages: the jump, the decent, and the landing.
<br/><br/>
You will jump from a height of %1 meters.
<br/><br/>
While descending, steer yourself towards the drop zone - 
orient yourself in the direction you want to go, then go forward.
<br/><br/>
The recommended open height for a HALO jump is 200 meters. 
100 meters is the absolute minimum. 
Anything less than 100 meters and you will not survive.
<br/><br/>
When you are getting close to the ground, try to move backwards.
This will slow you down and prevent injuries.
<br/><br/>
If you are being paradropped in a vehicle, 
you do not need to do anything. Just sit tight and enjoy the descent.
The vehicle will automatically deploy a parachute at an appropriate time. 
If you get out of the vehicle while it is descending, you will not survive. 
<br/>
If a group leader initiates the jump while you are not in the same vehicle,
you will jump alongside the vehicle, 
but you have your own parachute which must be opened manually.
