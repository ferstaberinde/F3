**INTRODUCTION**

This is a collection of various functions I have written and am writing for my Arma 3 missions.
None of them are revolutionary but all of them have been designed with efficiency and performance in mind.
The idea is to reduce the need for repetitive scripting as much as possible while avoiding the need for third-party scripts and the problems that come with that. 
I've also tried and comment everything as best as possible to make understanding the code easier.


**SETUP & DOCUMENTANTION**

Installation-guides and further documentation can be found on the wiki:  
https://github.com/Wolfenswan/ws_fnc/wiki

* All major functions are documented in themselves. To see how they work open their .sqf with a text editor or their pages on github. 

* If you're running ArmA 3 then you can also seem them all in the editor when opening the function viewer (CTRL+F). Make sure to select "missionConfigFile" in the top-left drop-down menu.
